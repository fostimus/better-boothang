## How Better BooThang Works

Better BooThang is an app that uses timers, pre-made texts, and basic info about your loved ones to send them that loving notification when you want. If you're brand new to the app, here's the quick run through.

Firstly, you would want to make an account with us. Before we can send anything to your boo we need to know about you!

Once we know you, tell us about your boo! We don't need anything too personal, just the simple things like their 
    - Name
    <!-- Commented Out until we reach a soft MVP -->
    <!-- - Birthday
    - The day you two said "okay" to dating each other -->

Set your message! Did you need to send a message about an anniversary? Did you almost forget about their birthday? Did you need to text them *every* day? Better BooThang has pre-made messages for every occasion! So if you're hitting a writer's block for your sentimental message, or you can't find the right words to write, Better BooThang has got you covered!

Next, pick *when* you want to send your messages! Our app allows you to choose the right time for you. Noon? 5pm? Midnight? Set it and forget it!
    <!-- Save specificity for AFTER MVP (Feasibility Check) -->
    <!-- - A specific date of the year
    - A special day of the month
    - A certain day of the week
    - Every single day. -->



## Motivation

With Project 2 being a team project, we all wanted to have some light hearted fun. We went through many different ideas, but ultimately settled on an idea from our instructor James. We instantly liked how silly the app seemed and we were adding features to the pitch. The next thing we knew, we had thought out ideas for a working product, wireframes, and extra features to give the app more quirkiness.
